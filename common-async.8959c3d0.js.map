thinking is a systematic and structured cognitive approach that requires individuals to move beyond intuition and superficial information, delving into the essence of a problem and its underlying principles through logical analysis, multi-perspective examination, and persistent inquiry. Unlike quick reactions or heuristic judgments, deep thinking emphasizes ​slow thinking, actively engaging knowledge reserves, critical thinking, and creativity to uncover deeper connections and meanings.\\nKey characteristics of deep thinking include:\\n​Probing the Essence: Not settling for \\\"what it is,\\\" but continuously asking \\\"why\\\" and \\\"how it works\\\" until reaching the fundamental logic.\\n​Multidimensional Connections: Placing the issue in a broader context and analyzing it through interdisciplinary knowledge or diverse perspectives.\\n​Skepticism & Reflection: Challenging existing conclusions, authoritative opinions, and even personal biases, validating them through logic or evidence.\\n​Long-term Value Focus: Prioritizing systemic consequences and sustainable impact over short-term or localized benefits.\\nThis mode of thinking helps individuals avoid cognitive biases in complex scenarios, improve decision-making, and generate groundbreaking
