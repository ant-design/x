## Installation

### Install via npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, or utoo

**We recommend using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [bun](https://bun.sh/), or [utoo](https://github.com/umijs/mako/tree/next) for development.** This allows easy debugging in development and reliable packaging for production, benefiting from the ecosystem and toolchain.

<InstallDependencies npm='$ npm install @ant-design/x --save' yarn='$ yarn add @ant-design/x' pnpm='$ pnpm install @ant-design/x --save' bun='$ bun add @ant-design/x' utoo='$ ut install @ant-design/x --save'></InstallDependencies>

If your network is unstable, consider using [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).

### Browser Import

You can use `script` and `link` tags to directly import files and use the global variable `antdx`.

The npm package's dist directory provides `antdx.js`, `antdx.min.js`, and `antdx.min.js.map`.

> **Not recommended to use built files** as they do not support on-demand loading and may not receive quick bug fixes for underlying dependencies.

> Note: `antdx.js` and `antdx.min.js` depend on `react`, `react-dom`, `dayjs`, `antd`, `@ant-design/cssinjs`, and `@ant-design/icons`. Please ensure these files are imported first.

## üß© Components

Based on the RICH interaction paradigm, we provide a variety of atomic components for different interaction stages to help you flexibly build your AI conversation app:

- General: `Bubble` - message bubble, `Conversations` - conversation management, `Notification` - system notification
- Wake-up: `Welcome` - welcome, `Prompts` - prompt set
- Expression: `Sender` - input box, `Attachment` - input attachment, `Suggestion` - quick command
- Confirmation: `Think` - thinking process, `ThoughtChain` - chain of thought
- Feedback: `Actions` - action list, `FileCard` - file card
- Others: `XProvider` - global config: theme, locale, etc.

Here is a simple example of building a chat box using atomic components:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  // Message bubble
  Bubble,
  // Input box
  Sender,
} from '@ant-design/x';

const messages = [
  {
    content: 'Hello, Ant Design X!',
    role: 'user',
    key: 'user_0',
  },
];

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Bubble.List items={messages} />
    <Sender />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Model/Agent Integration & AI Conversation Data Flow

With [X SDK](/x-sdks/introduce), you can easily integrate models and agent services, along with useful utilities.

## ‚ú® High-performance Markdown Streaming Engine

We provide an optimized [X Markdown](/x-markdowns/introduce) rendering solution for streaming content, with powerful extension capabilities. It supports formulas, code highlighting, mermaid charts, and delivers excellent performance for smooth content display.

## On-demand Loading

`@ant-design/x` supports tree shaking based on ES modules by default.

## TypeScript

`@ant-design/x` is written in TypeScript and provides complete type definitions.
