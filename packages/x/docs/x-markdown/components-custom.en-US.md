XMarkdown supports a highly flexible business component rendering mechanism, allowing developers to implement customized functionality through the following approaches:

1. **Custom Data Interaction**: Define data request logic autonomously within the component
2. **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Real-time acquisition and parsing of model-returned data
3. **Visual Presentation**: Freely configure rendering solutions according to business requirements

## Code Examples
