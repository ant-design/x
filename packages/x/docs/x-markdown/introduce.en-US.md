## Installation

### Install with npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, or utoo

**We recommend using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [bun](https://bun.sh/), or [utoo](https://github.com/umijs/mako/tree/next) for development.** This not only allows for easy debugging in the development environment but also enables confident packaging and deployment in the production environment, enjoying the many benefits of the entire ecosystem and toolchain.

<InstallDependencies npm='$ npm install @ant-design/x-markdown --save' yarn='$ yarn add @ant-design/x-markdown' pnpm='$ pnpm install @ant-design/x-markdown --save' bun='$ bun add @ant-design/x-markdown' utoo='$ ut install @ant-design/x-markdown --save'></InstallDependencies>

If you have a poor network environment, it is recommended to use [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).

### Browser Import

Use `script` and `link` tags to directly import files in the browser and use the global variable `XMarkdown`.

We provide `x-markdown.js`, `x-markdown.min.js`, and `x-markdown.min.js.map` in the `dist` directory of the npm package.

> **It is strongly not recommended to use the built files.** This prevents on-demand loading and makes it difficult to get quick bug fixes for underlying dependencies.

> Note: `x-markdown.js`, `x-markdown.min.js`, and `x-markdown.min.js.map` depend on `react` and `react-dom`. Please make sure to import these files beforehand.

## Example

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { XMarkdown } from '@ant-design/x-markdown';
const content = `
# Hello World

### Welcome to XMarkdown!

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
`;

const App = () => <XMarkdown content={content} />;

export default App;
```
